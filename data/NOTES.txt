I have finished the bioinformatics pipeline for the 16 Farm dataset using QIIME2 needed for 
the stats section of the metabarcoding paper. Briefly, I have separated out the ZBJ amplicons, 
ran quality control, assigned taxonomy to these using a naïve Bayes classifier and created an OTU table. 
I decided to keep the analysis to one primer to make the tutorial as simple as possible. As the table was 
created from QIIME2 it is a little different from the classic OTU table. Column A contains the feature ID, 
columns B to HT contain the number of times each feature was found in each sample (e.g the first sample is 100)
 and columns HU-HZ give the taxonomy assigned to each feature. Finally, column IB contains the confidence at 
which the taxonomy was assigned to each feature. Please let me know if the information in the OTU table isn’t clear.

The OTU names are codes that represent each sequence. I agree that it would be better to change them to something more simple. 
They are all unique so they could be numbered from 1 to 3105.
